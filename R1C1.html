      <b>ONYX Ultra</b><br><br>
      The ONYX Ultra is a fully integrated and interactive system for soccer training. The Ultra is a 360-degree
      environment that helps players train their soccer skills such as agility, accuracy, and shooting velocity. The dome
     is equipped with 24 addressable ball target modules that sense the force of the ball impact and measure ball
     speed using affordable radar sensors. The suspended tensioned 360-degree net provides direct reverberation,
     creating dynamic feedback similar to a soccer match. The functions and training settings can be operated with a
     gentle tap on the control module or with the additional software application. Multiple stereo speakers create
      additional feedback to the user(s) if the destined module is hit or not. The ONYX Ultra dome is destined for the
      business market (B2B) and can be installed indoors as well as outdoors.

      <br><b>The target module</b><br><br>
      The Ultra has 24 addressable target modules that are capable of measuring ball force with the use of
      piezocoaxial cable. Piezocoaxial cables, mostly seen in fence detection systems, are capable of extremely
      accurate measurements. The custom PCBA has integrated high-power RGB LEDs and radar sensors able to
      measure ball speed using the Doppler effect. The combination of high power LED, the sunshade cover, and a
      targeted rating of IP44 makes it possible to use the Ultra in almost any weather environment.

      The primary idea was not devised personally but initiated by children during multiple co-design sessions. For this,
      a co-design setup was devised in detail substantiated in academic knowledge. Additionally, academic knowledge
